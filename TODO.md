- [ ] integrate OpenGL (pyqtgraph.opengl) into main application's "Graphs" tabs
- [ ] implement greeks for european options
- [ ] lock save, calculate buttons 
    - [ ] when at least one input section isn't valid
    - [ ] after calculation when same (valid) inputs remain
- [ ] clear table, progress bar, graphs on new (uncalculated) input to reflect state
- [ ] add axis labels
- [ ] add heatmap to option value surface
- [ ] solve 3D graph update calls
- [ ] panning 3D scene
- [ ] scale increments to avoid oblong plotting
- [ ] resolve all Exception breakpoints
- [ ] add graph control details [?]
- [ ] heatmap in values table
- [ ] add axis labels https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pyqtgraph/JHviWSaGhckpy
- [ ] add heatmap / texture to option value surface
- [ ] convert surface to mesh?
- [ ] solve 3D graph update calls
- [ ] update README
- [ ] add informtion on how to debug to README
    - [ ] add VCForPython notes to README
    - [ ] add 3D view controls description to README 
    - [ ] 3D visualizations use the following mouse interaction:
    - [ ]  **Left button drag**: Rotates the scene around a central point
    - [ ]  **Middle button drag**: Pan the scene by moving the central look-at point within the x-y plane
    - [ ]  **Middle button drag + CTRL**: Pan the scene by moving the central look-at point along the z axis
    - [ ] Wheel spin: zoom in/out
    - [ ]  **Wheel + CTRL**: change field-of-view angle

- [ ]  get finish signal from pricer... only render 3D when done
- [ ]  convert prices to Z in [-1, 1] and shift grid downward by calculated amount to force heightColor shader to work. 
- [ ]  hide plot surface if pricing dimensions have changed
- [ ]
